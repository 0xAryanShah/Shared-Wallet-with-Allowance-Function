# Shared-Wallet-with-Allowance-Function
Shared Wallet with Allowance Function: <br>
- <h2>Real-World Use-Case for this Project<h2> <br>
  • Allowance for Children per day/week/month to be able to spend a certain amount of funds. <br>
  • Employers give employees an allowance for their travel expenses. <br>
  • Businesses give contractors an allowance to spend a certain budget.<br>
- <h2>Development Goal<h2>
  • Have an on-chain wallet smart contract. <br>
  • This wallet contract can store funds and let users withdraw again. <br>
  • You can also give “allowance” to other, specific user-addresses.<br>
  • Restrict the functions to specific user-roles (owner, user)<br>
  • Re-Use existing smart contracts which are already audited to the greatest extent.<br>
